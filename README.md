# Repo for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data assignment
Contains the files for the assignment as part of the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course

## Files included in the Repo
1. Assignment.R: This is the only script file and contains all the code for getting the tidy data set
2. README.md: This file
3. CodeBook.md: The markdown file describing the variables and the transformations required to ge the tidy data
4. TidyData.txt: The output tidy data file

## How to run the script
1. Create a subfolder under the working directory with the name "UCI HAR Dataset"
2. Download the compressed data and copy the unzipped files into this folder. Ensure that the files activity_labels.txt and features.txt are directly under the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder, along with the child folders for test and train
3. Copy the Assignment.R in the working directory and run it. It should create the TidyData.txt file

Read the CodeBook.md file to understand how the raw data was transformed into the tidy data.
